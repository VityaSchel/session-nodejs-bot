# Session Node.js Client

# DEPRECATED

Please consider switching to [Session.js](https://github.com/VityaSchel/session.js) â€” new framework made by me from scratch which runs on blazingly fast Bun.sh runtime instead of one specific Node.js version. It is highly customizable and flexible, allowing you to create hundreds of Session instances in one file, run multiple pollers with different settings, generally more stable and much faster.
